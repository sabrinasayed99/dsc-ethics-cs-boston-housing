    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore the nitty-gritty about why the Boston Housing data set is so problematic so you can spot __sensitive features__ and handle them accordingly. You will also touch on __data integrity issues__, a topic that we will explore in further detail in future lessons. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Download and read the Boston Housing data set from GitHub\n",
    "* Identify and describe common data integrity issues\n",
    "* Identify and describe sensitive features and possible negative impacts\n",
    "* Discuss the reasons why the Boston Housing Data set is not an appropriate sample data set"

    "While the intentions of the study designers may not have been racially motivated, they were not sensitive to the potential detrimental consequences of the features they selected for their study. They failed use caution when including the \"B\" feature which led to the misappropriation of the data set over the course of its life as an educational tool. They did not consider how the set of features without the appropriate context could reinforce negative stereotypes about black communities. "
